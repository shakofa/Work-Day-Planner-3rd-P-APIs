# Work-Day-Planner

## :page_with_curl: Description and :memo: Features
A planner for a work day created using HTML and JavaScript.In this project the main focus was on using jQuery library code to add current Date and Time to the page and loop over the blocks of codes on indext.html file.This web page also incorporates the usage of the Moment.js library to display the date and time. On the web page the current Date and Time are displaying. Events can be entered in the row corresponding to the time, which can then be saved to localStorage by clicking the icon to the right of the rows, so that the data persists. The color of the row changes with the time: pink being time past, purple being the current hour and light blue for events later in the day
